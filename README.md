# AirWare
A internet based file injection software for installing software via the internet without the need to download via a link for automation tasks. Works along side with Puppet scripting.

# The idea

The idea of this project is to show people how injecting certain files directly 
into a computer could be a account safety risk. It could be used to directly infect a computer system with a modified strain of a malware varient. Such is the way of ransomware attacks. Truly scary!

# TODO
* Create the actual fucking program instead of thinking about it.
* Work and test on the idea with some friends from college.
* Test the functionally of the software and test third party scripts.
* Integrate security to the software to prevent malware and information compromisation.
